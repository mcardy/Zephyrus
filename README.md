Zephyrus
========

Zephyrus is an all in one magic plugin. It has many magical features such as spells, items and enchantments that are meant to be used on survival and RPG servers alike. It supports economies, worldguard, permissions, and more! It also has an API that allows other developers to create add-ons. The name is pronounced Zef-er-uhs and comes from the Greek god of the West Wind.

Zephyrus also comes complete with an API for add-ons. An example add-on can be found here:

A plugin manual is coming soon and so is proper documentation on how to use the API.

Zephyrus is licenced under GNU General Public Licence version 3
